<h2>Linear Measurement: Metric and Imperial</h2><br><br><br>
Linear measurement is when you measure things in a straight line using<br><br><br>
tools such as a ruler, yardstick or tape measure. The following
table shows different types of linear measurement.<br><br><br>
Note: Metric and/or imperial units can be used to measure linear measurements.<br><br><br>
One example is provided for each type of linear measurement.<br><br><br>

examples of linear measurement.<br><br><br>

Measuring Length: Metric System<br><br><br>
The base unit for length is the metre (m).<br><br><br>
Units used to measure length depend on what is being measured. For example,<br><br><br>
• distance between towns and cities is measured in kilometres<br><br><br>
• width of a textbook is measured in millimetres or centimetres<br><br><br>
• height is measured in metres and centimetres.<br><br><br>

Measuring Length: Imperial System<br><br><br>
Units for measuring length in the imperial system are inches, feet, yards and miles.<br><br><br>
12 inches = 1 foot<br><br><br>
3 feet or 36 inches = 1 yard<br><br><br>
1760 yards or 5280 feet = 1 mile<br><br><br>
Symbols/abbreviations:<br><br><br>
inch = in. or " 1 in. or 1"<br><br><br>
foot = ft. or ' 1 ft. or 1'<br><br><br>
yard = yd. or yds. 1 yd.<br><br><br>
mile = mi. 1 mi.<br><br><br>

Inches and fractions of inches (e.g., 8<br><br><br>
1 of an inch) are used when measuring small<br><br><br>
things, such as the length, width and height of a table, desk or book.<br><br><br>
Feet and yards are used to take larger measurements, such as the height of a door (ft.)<br><br><br>
or the distance from the school to the school yard (ft. or yds.).<br><br><br>
Miles are used to measure longer distances.<br><br><br>
Fractions and the Imperial System<br><br><br>
The whole numbers—1, 2, 3, etc.—on an imperial ruler represent an inch. Each inch is<br><br><br>
divided into 16 smaller parts. The half and quarter inches are shown with the slightly<br><br><br>
longer line segments. <br><br><br>
