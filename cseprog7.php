<h2>Setting up C++ Development Environment</h2><br>
C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features.<br>
C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. Before we start programming with C++. We will need an environment to be set-up on our local computer to compile and run our C++ programs successfully.If you do not want to setup a local environment you can also use online IDEs for compiling your program.<br><br>

Using online IDE: IDE stands for integrated development environment. IDE is a software application that provides facilities to a computer programmer for developing softwares. There are many online IDEs available which you can use to compile and run your programs easily without setting up a local development environment.<br><br>


Setting up local environment<br><br>

For setting up your own personal development environment on your local machine you need to install two important softwares:<br><br><br>

Windows Installation:<br> There are lots of IDE available for windows operating system which you can use to work easily with C++ programming language. One of the popular IDE is Code::Blocks. To download Code::Blocks you may visit this link. Once you have downloaded the setup file of Code::Blocks from the given link open it and follow the instruction to install.<br><br>
After successfully installing Code::Blocks, go to File menu -> Select New and create an Empty file.<br>
Now write your C++ program in this empty file and save the file with a ‘.cpp’ extension.<br>
After saving the file with ‘.cpp’ extension, go to Build menu and choose the Build and Run option.<br><br><br>

Mac OS X Installation: If you are a Mac user,you have to download Xcode. To download Xcode you have to visit the apple website or you can search it on apple app store. You may follow the link developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/ to download Xcode. You will find all the necessary install instructions there.<br>
After successfully installing Xcode, open the Xcode application.
To create a new project. Go to File menu -> select New -> select Project. This will create a new project for you.<br>
Now in the next window you have to choose a template for your project. To choose a C++ template choose Application option which is under the OS X section on the left side bar. Now choose command-line tools from available options and hit Next button.<br>
On the next window provide all the necessary details like ‘name of organisation’, ‘Product Name’ etc. But make sure to choose the language as C++ . After filling the details hit the next button to proceed to further steps.<br>
Choose the location where you want to save your project. After this choose the main.cpp file from the directory list on the left side-bar.<br>
Now after opening the main.cpp file, you will see a pre written c++ program or template is provided. You may change this program as per your requirement. To run your C++ program you have to go to Product menu and choose the Run option from the dropdown.<br><br><br>
