<h2>Digital Circuit Simulation</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br>
TINA includes several powerful engines for digital circuit simulation. TINA solves the logic state equation at each node and displays the results. Trace the operation of the circuit step-by-step forward and backward, or use TINA's auto-running mode. The event-driven digital circuit simulation engine also keeps track of internal states, allowing the study of digital hazards. In addition TINA presents the complete time diagram of a digital circuit. Digital signals are displayed in a special logic analyzer style window where each signal is displayed in a separate coordinate system. You can also view the result of digital simulation in TINA's Logic Analyzer virtual instrument. Digital components in TINA include basic digital parts such as Gates, Flip-Flops, Logic ICs and complex digital components such as MCUs, AD and DA converters, VHDL and Verilog components. You can of course also mix digital and analog components. Such so called mixed circuits are discussed at Mixed Circuit Simulation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Basic digital circuits<br><br><br><br>
TINA's component libraries include of lot of digital components from gates to digital ICs. <br><br><br>
Gates: buffer, tri-state buffer, inverter, Schmidt inverter, AND (2, 3, and 4 inputs), OR (2, 3, and 4 inputs), NAND (2, 3, and 4 inputs), NOR (2, 3, and 4 inputs), and XOR  <br><br><br>
Flip-flops: D latch, D flip-flop, SR flip-flop, JK flip-flop  <br><br><br>
Digital ICs: 74000 logic family, 4000 logic family<br><br><br>
<br><br>
Microcontroller (MCU) circuits<br><br><br>
TINA includes a wide range of microcontrollers (PIC, AVR, 8051, HCS, ARM) which you can test, debug and run interactively. The built in MCU assembler allows you to modify your assembler code and see the result promptly. You can also program and debug MCUs in C, using external C compilers.<br><br><br><br>

a method of investigating real phenomena, processes, devices, or systems that is based on the study of mathematical models with the aid of digital computers. The program executed by the computer is also a kind of model of the subject of the investigation. Special problem-oriented simulation languages are used in digital simulation. CSMP, which was developed in the USA in the 1960â€™s, is an example of a commonly used language. Digital simulation is distinguished by its clarity of representation and is characterized by a high degree of automation of the investigation of real phenomena, processes, devices, or systems.<br><br><br>
