Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a standard created by the IMS Global Learning Consortium that links content and resources to learning platforms.<br><br><br>

Its primary purpose is to connect learning systems such as a learning management system (LMS) with external service tools in a standard way across learning systems. The standard describes the connecting system as an LTI Tool Consumer and the connected tool as an LTI Tool Provider.<br><br><br>

LTI Consumer: This is the service that is consuming the tool. Typically this is a Learning Management System (LMS) or user portal. The LTI Consumer provides user information and context to the LTI Tool Provider. Additionally the LTI Consumer provides authentication vouching for the user to the LTI Tool Provider.[2]

LTI Tool Provider: This is the service providing the service to the LTI Consumer. This can be on-premises software or a service that is hosted outside the LTI Consumer.<br><br><br><br>

The initial implementation of Learning Tools Interoperability, then called BasicLTI, was developed in 2008 as a Google Summer of Code project developed by Jordi Piguillem under the mentorship of Charles Severance and Marc Alier.<br><br><br><br>
In June 2010 the final specifications for LTI v1.0 were released by the IMS Global Learning Consortium.<br><br><br>
In August 2012 the final specifications for LTI v1.1 were released by the IMS Global Learning Consortium. The ability to pass grades back to the Tool Consumer from the Tool Provider is added.<br><br><br>
In January 2014 the final specifications for LTI v2.0 were released by the IMS Global Learning Consortium. It supports rich and complex REST based two way communication between LTI Consumer and Provider.<br><br><br>
LTI v1.2 and v2.0 have been marked as deprecated in favor of LTI v1.3 [10]
