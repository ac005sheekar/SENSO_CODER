Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.[2] There are several types of friction:<br><br><br><br>

Dry friction is a force that opposes the relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. Dry friction is subdivided into static friction ("stiction") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction between moving surfaces. With the exception of atomic or molecular friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface features, known as asperities<br><br><br><br><br>
Fluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other.[3][4]<br><br><br>
Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid separates two solid surfaces.[5][6][7]<br><br><br>
Skin friction is a component of drag, the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body.<br><br><br>
Internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation.[4]<br><br><br>
When surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (that is, it converts work to heat). This property can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a viscous fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components. Friction is a component of the science of tribology.<br><br><br><br>

Friction is desirable and important in supplying traction to facilitate motion on land. Most land vehicles rely on friction for acceleration, deceleration and changing direction. Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and accidents.<br><br><br>

Friction is not itself a fundamental force. Dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion, surface roughness, surface deformation, and surface contamination. The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from first principles impractical and necessitates the use of empirical methods for analysis and the development of theory.<br><br><br>

Friction is a non-conservative force - work done against friction is path dependent. In the presence of friction, some energy is always lost in the form of heat. Thus mechanical energy is not conserved.<br><br><br>


The elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:<br><br><br><br>

Amontons' First Law: The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load.<br><br><br><br>
Amontons' Second Law: The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.<br><br><br>
Coulomb's Law of Friction: Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.<br><br><br>
Dry friction<br><br><br>
Dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' ("stiction") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.<br><br><br>

Coulomb friction, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:<br><br><br>

{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\leq \mu F_{\mathrm {n} },} {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\leq \mu F_{\mathrm {n} },}<br><br><br>


{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\,} F_{\mathrm {f} }\, is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other. It is parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied force.<br><br><br><br><br>
{\displaystyle \mu \,} \mu \, is the coefficient of friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,<br><br><br><br>
{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {n} }\,} F_{\mathrm {n} }\, is the normal force exerted by each surface on the other, directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.<br><br><br>
The Coulomb friction {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\,} F_{\mathrm {f} }\, may take any value from zero up to {\displaystyle \mu F_{\mathrm {n} }\,} \mu F_{\mathrm {n} }\,, and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as traction.<br><br><br><br><br>

The force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
