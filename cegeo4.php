<h2>Geological Methods</h2><br><br><br>


Geology (from the Ancient Greek γῆ, gē("earth") and -λoγία, -logia, ("study of", "discourse")[1][2]) is an earth science concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. Geology can also refer to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other earth sciences, including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated earth system science and planetary science.<br><br><br>

Geology describes the structure of the Earth beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped that structure. It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location, and also to describe the histories of those rocks.[citation needed] By combining these tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole, and also to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth's past climates.<br><br><br>

Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including field work, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology, a major academic discipline, also plays a role in geotechnical engineering.<br><br><br>

The majority of research in geology is associated with the study of rock, as rock provides the primary record of the majority of the geologic history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle illustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).<br><br><br>

When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock. It can then be turned into a metamorphic rock by heat and pressure that change its mineral content, resulting in a characteristic fabric. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once more crystallize.<br><br><br>


Minerals<br><br><br>
Tests<br><br><br>
To study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed. Each mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. The specimens can be tested for:<br><br><br>

Luster: Measurement of the amount of light reflected from the surface. Luster is broken into metallic and nonmetallic.<br><br><br>
Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral’s color.<br><br><br>
Streak: Performed by scratching the sample on a porcelain plate. The color of the streak can help name the mineral.<br><br><br>
Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratch.<br><br><br>
Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or cleavage, the former being breakage of uneven surfaces and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.<br><br><br>
Specific gravity: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.<br><br><br>
Effervescence: Involves dripping hydrochloric acid on the mineral to test for fizzing.<br><br><br>
Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for magnetism.<br><br><br>
Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste, like halite (which tastes like table salt).<br><br><br>
Smell: Minerals can have a distinctive odor. For example, sulfur smells like rotten eggs.<br><br><br>
Unconsolidated material
Geologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as drift), which typically come from more recent deposits. These materials are superficial deposits that lie above the bedrock.[4] This study is often known as Quaternary geology, after the Quaternary period of geologic history.<br><br><br>

Plate tectonics<br><br><br>

Oceanic-continental convergence resulting in subduction and volcanic arcs illustrates one effect of plate tectonics.<br><br><br>
In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading[5][6] and the global distribution of mountain terrain and seismicity.<br><br><br>

There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by bulk movement of molecules within fluids). Thus, oceanic plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction — because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
